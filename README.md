# 3rdparty services
PHP tool to test third 3rd services validity.  
Note that this is an automated tool, manual check is still required.  

```
Usage: php 3rdparty.php -d <subdomain> -s <service>

Options:
	-d	set subdomain to test
	-l	list services that are supported
	-s	set service to test
	-h	print this help

Examples:
	php 3rdparty.php -d yahoo -s zendesk
```

I don't believe in license.  
You can do want you want with this program.
